Required
--------
0. construct_homography
1. Test construct_homography vs findHomography
2. Write function to apply homography to image
3. Test function against warpPerspective
4. Get the whole image into the transformed image.
5. Use remap + interpolation to make the images look ok.
6. Implement the algorithm to solve only for inhomogeneous coordinates (system
of 9 equations), we don't really need 12. Also update blog post to reflect
this.
------------------------------------------------
7. Figure out what the teacher meant by the program should take distance as input?

Optional
--------
1. Read code of findHomography with SVD
